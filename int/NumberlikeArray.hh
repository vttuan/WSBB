	* Change made on 2005.01.06:
	*
	* If a zero-length NumberlikeArray is desired, no array is actually allocated.
	* Instead, `blk' is set to `NULL', and `cap' and `len' are zero as usual.
	*
	* `blk' is never dereferenced if the array has zero length.  Furthermore,
	* `delete NULL;' does nothing and causes no error. Therefore, we can use
	* `NULL' as if it were a zero-length array from `new'.
	*
	* This is a great convenience because the only code that need be changed
	* is the array allocation code.  All other code will still work file.

	* Otherwise, this default constructor will be implicitly invoked, pointing `blk' to
	* `NULL', a fake zero-length block array.  The derived class can allocate the desired
	* array itself and overwrite `blk'; it need not `delete [] blk' first.
	*
	* This change fixes a memory leak reported by Milan Tomic on 2005.01.06.
	* Integer-type-to-BigUnsigned (and BigInteger) conversion constructors have always
	* allocated their own array of length 0 or 1 after seeing whether the input is zero.
	* But when the NumberlikeArray transition occurred, these constructors contained an
	* implicit initializer call to the old NumberlikeArray default constructor, which
	* created a real `new'-allocated zero-length array.  This array would then be lost,
	* causing a small but annoying memory leak.

* =================================
* BELOW THIS POINT are template definitions; above are declarations.
*
* Definitions would ordinarily belong in a file NumberlikeArray.cc so that they would
* be compiled once into NumberlikeArray.o and then linked.
*
* However, because of the way templates are usually implemented,
* template ``definitions'' are treated as declarations by the compiler.
* When someone uses an instance of the template, definitions are generated,
* and the linker is smart enough to toss duplicate definitions for the same
* instance generated by different files.
*
* Thus, the template ``definitions'' for NumberlikeArray must appear in this header file
* so other files including NumberlikeArray will be able to generate real definitions.
