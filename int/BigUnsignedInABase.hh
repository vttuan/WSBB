/*
* A BigUnsignedInABase object represents a nonnegative
* integer of size limited only by available memory,
* represented in a user-specified base that can fit in
* an `unsigned short' (most can, and this saves memory).
*
* BigUnsignedInABase is intended as an intermediary class
* with little functionality of its own.  BigUnsignedInABase
* objects can be constructed from, and converted to,
* BigUnsigneds (requiring multiplication, mods, etc.) and
* `std::string's (by switching digit values for appropriate
* characters).
*
* BigUnsignedInABase is similar to BigUnsigned.  Note the following:
*
* (1) They represent the number in exactly the same way, except
* that BigUnsignedInABase uses ``digits'' (or Digit) where BigUnsigned uses
* ``blocks'' (or Blk).
*
* (2) Both use the management features of NumberlikeArray.  (In fact,
* my desire to add a BigUnsignedInABase class without duplicating a
* lot of code led me to introduce NumberlikeArray.)
*
* (3) The only arithmetic operation supported by BigUnsignedInABase
* is an equality test.  Use BigUnsigned for arithmetic.

	*
	* All string representations are big-endian (big-place-value digits first).

	* tolerate little-endian numbers?  It makes a lot of sense!)

	* No string representation has a ``base indicator'' like ``0x''.

	* An exception is made for zero: it is converted to ``0'' and not the empty string.

	* If you want different conventions, write your
	* own routines to go between BigUnsignedInABase and strings.  It's not hard.
